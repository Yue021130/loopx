"""Credential-resolved default Turn host binding and managed executor readback.

The default host for ``loopx turn plan`` and ``loopx turn run-once`` is decided
by what the operator configured, not by the harness alone:

- a configured operator model credential selects the DeepSeek Harness host
  (``dsh``), so the bounded Turn runs on the operator-supplied endpoint instead
  of any individual's CLI subscription;
- with no operator credential configured the default stays the Codex CLI host
  (``codex-cli``).

Resolution is a pure function of the environment so the command defaults, the
Turn plan readback, and tests quote one rule instead of drifting apart.

``managed_executor_binding`` turns the same facts into the readback a caller can
act on before a Turn runs: which executor the plan would use, whether that
executor is bound to an operator credential or to an individual CLI host, and
whether the managed host can actually launch here. An executor LoopX can prove
cannot launch is reported as unavailable so the Turn fails closed instead of
drifting onto another executor.
